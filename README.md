# SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION

The six degrees of separation theory states that any inhabitant of the Earth could meet anyone in the world with a maximum of six or fewer mutual connections between them and another person. Be it through acquaintances, friends, or members of their family.

The app was made using React and the styling was done using Tailwiind CSS.

In this app you can add new people and add their friends too. You can search for the degree of separation between two people.

For this app to work perfectly add at least two people first and then try to find connection between people.
